# Ansible variable to force recreate continuous queries
# recreate_cqs=yes

# you need to overwrite this with your own definition:
ansible_influx_databases:
  level_0:
    name: "telegraf"
    retention_policy: { amount: "0", unit: "s", name: "autogen" }

# Predefined set of queries for standard telegraf inputs
# You can overwrite these selectively with the variable "my_ansible_influx_queries"
# Use the same structure as below.

# Attention!
# columns have to be named explicitly, otherwise influxdb will prepend the aggregation
# method name (e.g. mean(usage_user) -> mean_usage_user)
